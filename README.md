## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed. You can download it from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
- **Dart SDK**: Usually bundled with Flutter, but make sure it's up-to-date.
- **IDE**: Preferably Visual Studio Code or Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins.
- **Device/Emulator**: A physical device or emulator to run the app.
Clone the repository:


**git clone https://github.com/Rono0365/edgeDetectionforDocsFlutter.git
**cd your-repo-name
##Install dependencies:


**flutter pub get
**Run the app:


**flutter run
Additional Configurations
Permissions: Ensure the necessary permissions are set in AndroidManifest.xml (for Android) and Info.plist (for iOS) for camera and storage access.


Architectural Decisions
**Flutter Framework
The app is built using the Flutter framework due to its cross-platform capabilities, allowing for a single codebase that runs on both iOS and Android devices. This ensures a consistent user experience across all platforms.

**MVC Pattern
The app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to separate the app's data, UI, and control logic. This separation enhances maintainability and scalability.
As a Flutter developer, I've found the BLoC pattern to be a game-changer in crafting robust and scalable mobile applications. This architectural approach effectively separates the business logic from the UI, leading to a cleaner, more testable, and maintainable codebase.

**Image Processing
The app leverages efficient image processing techniques to detect edges. By utilizing libraries such as image and mlkit and tflite, the app ensures high accuracy and performance in edge detection.
